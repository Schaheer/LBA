   @brief Provides information about the *mode* 4 FingerID is currently in, where the hand / digit
   should be placed within the camera view, and if the user is able to decide to alter which
   hand they are capturing.
   @discussion configureUI() will be called whenever 4 FingerID indicates it would like to capture a
   particular print, and this may occur several times. For example, when configured to capture
   both the left and right hand `configureUI()` will be called twice; once at the start
   of left hand capture, and again after successful capture of the left hand to begin right hand capture.
   @param captureMode The mode that the UI should prepare capture for. You should layout your UI
                accordingly.
   @param PrintToCapture Which fingerprint, or prints, are about to be captured
   @param TargetRegion A rectangle indicating the region in the camera preview a user should
                            place their fingers within. You should use this region to position your
                            hand guide on screen. Values are normalised to the camera preview.
                            For example, an x value of 0.5 is the centre of the preview. A width
                            value of 0.25 is 25% the width of the preview. Note: this area will
                            differ between devices, so do not use a static positioning of UI
                            components.
    @param CanSwitchHand TRUE if the user is allowed to choose to switch hands during capture. If
                         TRUE you should provide a mechanism for the user to change hands (see
                         FourFUIIntegrationWrapper.requestSwitchHand()). If FALSE, disable any
                         UI for hand switching.
